<p>This diagram shows the main components of the MVVM architecture:</p>

<p>Model: Represents the application data and business logic.</p>
<p>View: Represents the user interface and visual elements.</p></p>
<p>ViewModel: Acts as an intermediary between the View and Model, exposing properties and commands for data binding and user interactions.
Additionally, a UserInteraction class represents user interactions with the View. The View communicates with the ViewModel, which in turn communicates with the Model. This separation of concerns promotes a more maintainable and testable architecture.</p>
